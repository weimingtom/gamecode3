This is the source code that accompanies Game Coding Complete, 3rd Edition, written by Michael McShaffry and published by Charles River Media.

It is a complete game engine on training wheels. Good for learning and seeing how real game engines are architected - but not ready for a real game. Getting to that point is up to you and your programmer buddies.
